# AldiMarketCheckout

**General Description:**<br>
This front-end Windows form represents a customer checkout application at a grocery store.

**Detailed Description:**<br>
After initial sign on, cashier can add/subtract different quantities of various products in the store by
pressing the image of the item to check out.  A fruit selection enables the fruit 
subcategory area.  Totals for individual products and the final bill amount are 
updated on the display as checkout occurs.  User can ultimately initiate payment, clear the screen 
for the next customer, or sign off.  File clsProducts.vb contains the core product prices and 
quantities, while file clsProducts.Fruit.vb contains the same information for fruit subcategory items.
